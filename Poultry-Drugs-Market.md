This segment accounted for a substantial portion of the market share.</li> <li><strong>Vaccines and Parasiticides:</strong> Vaccines emerged as a key focus area for poultry health, with increased investment in immunization programs to combat avian diseases like avian influenza. Parasiticides also saw a rise in demand due to the growing incidence of parasitic infections in poultry.</li> <li><strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong> The period also saw stricter regulations surrounding the use of antibiotics, especially in developed countries.
